<p>The study found there was no difference between surgery and conservative treatment in patient-reported knee scores at two or five years. The study failed to report on the number of participants in each group who had any type of serious or non-serious complications. However, surgery-related complications included three cases of graft rupture in the surgery group and several participants of the conservative treatment group had unstable knees. Twenty-three of the 59 participants in the conservative treatment group (39%) had either reconstruction of the ACL or repair of a meniscus tear within two years and 30 (51%) underwent surgery within five years. There was some evidence that similar numbers of participants in the two groups had surgical treatment of knee meniscal injuries at five years. There was very low-quality evidence that more participants in the surgery group had damage to the knee that could mean that they were at greater risk of developing osteoarthritis. </p>

<p>Prospective screening for HLA-B*57:01 probably reduces severe hypersensitivity skin reactions to abacavir in patients positive for HIV-type 1. However, these results are only based on one study, which was at high risk of attrition and detection bias. Our primary outcomes (incidence of severe skin rashes with systemic symptoms, and long-term effects) were not assessed by the trial, and only one of the review’s secondary outcomes was measured (hypersensitivity reaction); thus, we found no evidence relating to hospitalisation, death, or long-term conditions resulting from drug injury. We found no eligible evidence on genetic testing for severe drug-induced skin rash in relation to different drugs and classes of drugs. Further clinical trials based on other drugs, and in different patient populations, would be useful for advising policy changes for improving the prevention of adverse skin reactions to drug treatments. </p>
<p>Screening for HLA-B*57:01 likely reduces severe skin reactions to abacavir in HIV-1 patients. However, these results come from a single study with a high risk of dropout and measurement errors. The trial did not assess our primary outcomes (severe skin rashes with systemic symptoms and long-term effects) and only measured one secondary outcome (hypersensitivity reaction). Therefore, we found no evidence related to hospitalization, death, or long-term conditions from drug injury. We found no suitable evidence on genetic testing for severe drug-induced skin rash linked to various drugs and drug classes. Conducting more clinical trials with different drugs and patient groups would help guide policy changes to better prevent adverse skin reactions to drug treatments. </p>

<p>Newborns born too early ('preterm'), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, have a higher risk of death, lung disease and brain impairment than those born at or near term. For instance, some of these babies develop intellectual disabilities, blindness or deafness. Chronic lung disease is a common problem in preterm babies who cannot breathe on their own and need assistance, whether through oxygen or mechanical ventilation (machine-assisted breathing). Bronchodilators are medicines that can widen the air passages in the lungs. They have been used to treat chronic lung disease because of their potential to open up small airways in the lungs of preterm babies. Giving bronchodilators to preterm infants may also be able to prevent chronic lung disease. Bronchodilators can be inhaled (via an inhaler, also known as a puffer), taken by mouth or injected, or received through a nebuliser (a device that makes the bronchodilator into a spray or mist that is easier to inhale). Possible negative effects include low potassium levels, fast heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels and lung collapse. </p>

<p>Coronary artery disease contributes to half of deaths caused by cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels) disease. Restoration of adequate blood flow through the coronary arteries can be achieved by introducing a catheter through a peripheral artery. This allows the introduction of balloons through the aorta (major artery of the heart) to dilate coronary artery narrowing or place arterial scaffolds (tubes called stents) to keep the coronary arteries open. Two main peripheral arteries can provide access; traditionally, the femoral (groin) artery, and more recently, the radial artery (one of two major arteries in the forearm). While gaining popularity, the transradial approach can be more challenging than the transfemoral approach, which may translate to longer procedural durations and technical failures. In addition, this raises concerns regarding radiation exposure to patients and physicians being higher with the transradial approach. We sought to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches to help inform healthcare decisions. Transradial access was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome (comprising two or more combined outcomes) of net adverse clinical events (NACE), including death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction (injury of the heart muscle), stroke (insult to the brain), need to reintervene on the same site of coronary artery stenosis (narrowing), and bleeding during the first 30 days following intervention. When assessing individual outcomes, the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was similar between groups. Transradial access reduced death from cardiac causes, death from all causes during the first 30 days following intervention, bleeding, and local complications at the access site. The transradial approach shortened the length of stay in hospital, but was associated with a higher radiation exposure and more technical failures requiring an alternate vascular access route. </p>
<p>Coronary artery disease causes half of all deaths from cardiovascular disease. Restoring blood flow through the coronary arteries can be done by inserting a catheter through a peripheral artery. This enables the use of balloons through the aorta to widen narrow coronary arteries or place stents to keep them open. Two main peripheral arteries can provide access: traditionally the femoral (groin) artery, and more recently, the radial artery (in the forearm). Although the transradial approach is becoming more popular, it can be more difficult than the transfemoral approach, potentially leading to longer procedures and technical failures. Additionally, this raises concerns about higher radiation exposure for both patients and physicians with the transradial approach. We compared the pros and cons of both approaches to guide healthcare decisions. Transradial access reduced the risk of negative clinical events, such as cardiac death, heart attack, stroke, the need for repeat artery procedures, and bleeding, within the first 30 days after the intervention. When evaluating individual outcomes, the risk of heart attack and stroke was similar in both groups. Transradial access reduced death from cardiac and all causes within 30 days, as well as bleeding and local access site complications. The transradial approach reduced hospital stay but led to higher radiation exposure and more technical failures needing alternate vascular access. </p>

<h3>Text #5:</h3>
<p>An aorto-iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto-iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. Endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent-graft) is placed inside the aorto-iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent-graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent-graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent-graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent-grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. </p>
<p>An aorto-iliac aneurysm is a bulging of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, and its iliac branches. An aortic abdominal aneurysm can grow and burst, causing severe bleeding that is often fatal; this results in an estimated 15,000 deaths annually in the USA. To prevent this complication, the aorto-iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the aorta's maximum diameter is 5-5.5 cm or when the common iliac arteries' maximum diameter is 3-4 cm. Endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms involves placing a stent-graft inside the aneurysm to redirect blood flow, effectively excluding the aneurysm from circulation. To successfully deploy the stent-graft, a good seal is needed in the aorta (proximal) and the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the seal in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, the stent-graft usually extends to the external iliac artery, blocking the internal iliac artery. This blockage can cause problems because the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs and muscles. Complications from this can include pain in the buttocks during exercise, sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. New endovascular devices and techniques, like iliac branch devices, now help maintain blood flow to the internal iliac artery. These special stent-grafts position the distal seal zone in the external iliac artery and have a side branch to revascularize the internal iliac artery, excluding the aneurysm from the circulation and ensuring both a proper seal and pelvic blood flow. This may also maintain the quality of life for treated individuals and reduce serious complications like spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. CVD is a global burden and varies between regions, and this variation has been linked in part to dietary factors. Such factors are important because they can be modified to help with CVD prevention and management. This review assessed the effectiveness of increased fibre intake as a supplement or in food stuffs in reducing cardiovascular death, all-cause death, non-fatal endpoints (such as heart attacks, strokes and angina) and CVD risk factors in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD. Twenty three trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All of the trials were short term and so could not examine the effect of fibre intake on CVD events. All of the trials examined the effects of fibre intake on lipid levels (lipids are fat-like substances, including cholesterol found in the blood), blood pressure or both. Pooling the results showed a beneficial reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (sometimes called 'bad' cholesterol), and diastolic blood pressure with increasing fibre intake. There were no clear patterns for the type of fibre used (soluble or insoluble fibre) or the way in which fibre was provided (via supplements or food stuffs) but their were few studies in each group so results are uncertain. </p>

<p>Breaks (fractures) of the lower part of the thigh bone (distal femur) are debilitating and painful injuries. The reduced mobility after these injuries is also an important cause of ill-health. Sometimes these fractures happen in people who have previously had a knee replacement; this can make treatment of the fracture more complicated. Many treatments have been used in the management of these injuries. Historically, people were treated in bed with weights holding the leg straight. More recently, surgery has been used to fix the broken femur using metal implants (surgical fixation). Methods of surgical fixation include using plates and screws on the outside the femur or rods inside the femur to hold the fracture in place while it heals. The technology of these implants has become increasingly advanced with components that 'lock' together, forming a 'locked' device. Despite these advances, the best management of these injuries remains controversial. </p>

<p>Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay for treatment of moderate or severe depression. Fluvoxamine is one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. This review reports trials comparing fluvoxamine with other antidepressants for treatment of major depression. We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, there is evidence of differing side-effect profiles, especially when comparing gastrointestinal side effects between fluvoxamine and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including these differences in side effect profiles. </p>

<p>Thalassaemia is a genetic (inherited) blood disorder that causes defects in adult haemoglobin (the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells) leading to destruction of the red blood cells and anaemia with different degrees of severity. Persistent anaemia can affect general health and reduce quality of life. People with NTDβT may require periodic blood transfusion to replace the red blood cells and this could lead to excess iron being deposited in various organs in the body, affecting their function. People with NTDβT have higher levels of HbF (the main form of haemoglobin found during the development of a baby before birth) which persists after birth. The amount of HbF that persists varies and people with a higher HbF level require less frequent blood transfusions. HbF inducers are substances which increase HbF levels without alteration to the gene. They may reduce the need for blood transfusion in people with NTDβT. However, it is not known which HbF inducers are effective and safe, and if so, what the optimal dose is and at what age treatment should be started. </p>

<p>PMS is characterised by a range of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms that are not due to any organic disease, and that occur during the luteal phase (second half) of the menstrual cycle and disappear at the onset of menstruation. It is now thought that the condition is due to complex interactions between ovarian steroids and neurotransmitters. A clinical diagnosis requires that the symptoms are confirmed by prospective recording for at least two menstrual cycles and that they cause substantial distress or impairment to daily life (e.g. work, school, social activities, hobbies, interpersonal relationships). We found very low quality evidence to suggest that oral unopposed oestrogen given in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is probably ineffective for controlling the symptoms of PMS and may even make them worse. There was very low quality evidence to support the effectiveness of continuous oestrogen (in the form of transdermal patches or subcutaneous implants) plus progestogen, with a small to moderate effect size. A comparison between 200 microgram and 100 microgram doses of continuous oestrogen was inconclusive with regard to effectiveness but suggested that the lower dose was less likely to cause side effects. Uncertainty remains regarding safety, as the identified studies were too small to provide definite answers. Moreover, none of the included trials addressed adverse effects that might occur beyond the typical trial duration of 2 to 8 months. This suggests the choice of oestrogen dose and mode of administration could be based on an individual woman’s preference and modified according to the effectiveness and tolerability of the chosen regimen. </p>
<p>PMS involves various physical, psychological, and behavioral symptoms that occur during the second half of the menstrual cycle and disappear when menstruation begins. These symptoms are not caused by any organic disease. The condition is now believed to result from complex interactions between ovarian hormones and brain chemicals. A clinical diagnosis needs symptoms to be recorded for at least two menstrual cycles and to cause significant distress or disruption to daily life. work, school, social activities, hobbies, and relationships. We found weak evidence that oral unopposed oestrogen taken during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is likely ineffective for PMS symptoms and may even worsen them. The evidence supporting the effectiveness of continuous estrogen (via patches or implants) plus progestogen was very low quality and showed a small to moderate effect. A comparison of 200 microgram and 100 microgram continuous oestrogen doses showed no clear difference in effectiveness but indicated the lower dose had fewer side effects. The identified studies were too small to provide definite answers, so safety remains uncertain. Additionally, none of the trials considered long-term adverse effects beyond the usual 2 to 8 months duration. This suggests that women can choose their oestrogen dose and method of administration based on their preferences and adjust it based on how well it works and how well they tolerate it. </p>
