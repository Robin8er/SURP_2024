<p><span style='background-color: Orange'>Endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent-graft) is placed inside the aorto-iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent-graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation.</span> <span style='background-color: Yellow'>To achieve a successful deployment of the stent-graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal).</span> <span style='background-color: LightGreen'>However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate.</span> <span style='background-color: Cyan'>In these cases, most commonly the stent-graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury.</span> <span style='background-color: Violet'>New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery.</span> <span style='background-color: Pink'>These special stent-grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation.</span> <span style='background-color: Orange'>This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis.</span> </p>

<p><span style='background-color: Orange'>Prospective screening for HLA-B*57:01 probably reduces severe hypersensitivity skin reactions to abacavir in patients positive for HIV-type 1.</span> <span style='background-color: Yellow'>However, these results are only based on one study, which was at high risk of attrition and detection bias. Our primary outcomes (incidence of severe skin rashes with systemic symptoms, and long-term effects) were not assessed by the trial, and only one of the reviewâ€™s secondary outcomes was measured (hypersensitivity reaction); thus, we found no evidence relating to hospitalisation, death, or long-term conditions resulting from drug injury.</span> <span style='background-color: LightGreen'></span> <span style='background-color: Cyan'>We found no eligible evidence on genetic testing for severe drug-induced skin rash in relation to different drugs and classes of drugs.</span> <span style='background-color: Violet'>Further clinical trials based on other drugs, and in different patient populations, would be useful for advising policy changes for improving the prevention of adverse skin reactions to drug treatments.</span> </p>
<p><span style='background-color: Orange'>One repair method is endovascular surgery, where a stent-graft is placed inside the aneurysm to redirect blood flow and exclude the aneurysm from circulation.

<p><span style='background-color: Orange'>Coronary artery disease contributes to half of deaths caused by cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels) disease. Restoration of adequate blood flow through the coronary arteries can be achieved by introducing a catheter through a peripheral artery.</span> <span style='background-color: Yellow'>This allows the introduction of balloons through the aorta (major artery of the heart) to dilate coronary artery narrowing or place arterial scaffolds (tubes called stents) to keep the coronary arteries open.</span> <span style='background-color: LightGreen'>Two main peripheral arteries can provide access; traditionally, the femoral (groin) artery, and more recently, the radial artery (one of two major arteries in the forearm).</span> <span style='background-color: Cyan'>While gaining popularity, the transradial approach can be more challenging than the transfemoral approach, which may translate to longer procedural durations and technical failures. In addition, this raises concerns regarding radiation exposure to patients and physicians being higher with the transradial approach. We sought to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches to help inform healthcare decisions.</span> <span style='background-color: Violet'>Transradial access was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome (comprising two or more combined outcomes) of net adverse clinical events (NACE), including death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction (injury of the heart muscle), stroke (insult to the brain), need to reintervene on the same site of coronary artery stenosis (narrowing), and bleeding during the first 30 days following intervention.</span> <span style='background-color: Pink'>When assessing individual outcomes, the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was similar between groups.</span> <span style='background-color: Orange'>Transradial access reduced death from cardiac causes, death from all causes during the first 30 days following intervention, bleeding, and local complications at the access site.</span> <span style='background-color: Yellow'>The transradial approach shortened the length of stay in hospital, but was associated with a higher radiation exposure and more technical failures requiring an alternate vascular access route.</span> </p>

<p><span style='background-color: Orange'>PMS is characterised by a range of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms that are not due to any organic disease, and that occur during the luteal phase (second half) of the menstrual cycle and disappear at the onset of menstruation.</span> <span style='background-color: Yellow'>It is now thought that the condition is due to complex interactions between ovarian steroids and neurotransmitters.</span> <span style='background-color: LightGreen'>A clinical diagnosis requires that the symptoms are confirmed by prospective recording for at least two menstrual cycles and that they cause substantial distress or impairment to daily life (e.g.</span> <span style='background-color: Cyan'>work, school, social activities, hobbies, interpersonal relationships).
