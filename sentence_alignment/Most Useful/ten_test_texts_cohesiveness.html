<p>The study found there was no difference between surgery and conservative treatment in patient-reported knee scores at two or five years. The study failed to report on the number of participants in each group who had any type of serious or non-serious complications. However, surgery-related complications included three cases of graft rupture in the surgery group and several participants of the conservative treatment group had unstable knees. Twenty-three of the 59 participants in the conservative treatment group (39%) had either reconstruction of the ACL or repair of a meniscus tear within two years and 30 (51%) underwent surgery within five years. There was some evidence that similar numbers of participants in the two groups had surgical treatment of knee meniscal injuries at five years. There was very low-quality evidence that more participants in the surgery group had damage to the knee that could mean that they were at greater risk of developing osteoarthritis. </p>

In the surgery group, there were three cases of graft rupture, while some in the conservative group had unstable knees. Of the 59 participants in the conservative group, 23 (39%) had ACL reconstruction or meniscus repair within two years, and 30 (51%) had surgery within five years. Similar numbers in both groups had meniscal surgery after five years. Low-quality evidence suggested more participants in the surgery group had knee damage, possibly increasing their risk of osteoarthritis. </p>

<p>Prospective screening for HLA-B*57:01 probably reduces severe hypersensitivity skin reactions to abacavir in patients positive for HIV-type 1. However, these results are only based on one study, which was at high risk of attrition and detection bias. Our primary outcomes (incidence of severe skin rashes with systemic symptoms, and long-term effects) were not assessed by the trial, and only one of the reviewâ€™s secondary outcomes was measured (hypersensitivity reaction); thus, we found no evidence relating to hospitalisation, death, or long-term conditions resulting from drug injury. We found no eligible evidence on genetic testing for severe drug-induced skin rash in relation to different drugs and classes of drugs. Further clinical trials based on other drugs, and in different patient populations, would be useful for advising policy changes for improving the prevention of adverse skin reactions to drug treatments. </p>
<p>Screening for HLA-B*57:01 likely reduces severe skin reactions to abacavir in HIV-1 patients. However, this conclusion is based on a single study with high risk of bias. The primary outcomes (severe skin rashes with systemic symptoms and long-term effects) were not assessed, and only one secondary outcome (hypersensitivity reaction) was measured. There was no evidence on hospitalization, death, or long-term conditions from drug injury. We also found no evidence on genetic testing for severe skin rashes caused by other drugs. More clinical trials on different drugs and patient populations are needed to guide policy changes for preventing adverse skin reactions. </p>

<p>Newborns born too early ('preterm'), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, have a higher risk of death, lung disease and brain impairment than those born at or near term. For instance, some of these babies develop intellectual disabilities, blindness or deafness. Chronic lung disease is a common problem in preterm babies who cannot breathe on their own and need assistance, whether through oxygen or mechanical ventilation (machine-assisted breathing). Bronchodilators are medicines that can widen the air passages in the lungs. They have been used to treat chronic lung disease because of their potential to open up small airways in the lungs of preterm babies. Giving bronchodilators to preterm infants may also be able to prevent chronic lung disease. Bronchodilators can be inhaled (via an inhaler, also known as a puffer), taken by mouth or injected, or received through a nebuliser (a device that makes the bronchodilator into a spray or mist that is easier to inhale). Possible negative effects include low potassium levels, fast heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure, high sugar levels and lung collapse. </p>

<p>Coronary artery disease contributes to half of deaths caused by cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels) disease. Restoration of adequate blood flow through the coronary arteries can be achieved by introducing a catheter through a peripheral artery. This allows the introduction of balloons through the aorta (major artery of the heart) to dilate coronary artery narrowing or place arterial scaffolds (tubes called stents) to keep the coronary arteries open. Two main peripheral arteries can provide access; traditionally, the femoral (groin) artery, and more recently, the radial artery (one of two major arteries in the forearm). While gaining popularity, the transradial approach can be more challenging than the transfemoral approach, which may translate to longer procedural durations and technical failures. In addition, this raises concerns regarding radiation exposure to patients and physicians being higher with the transradial approach. We sought to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches to help inform healthcare decisions. Transradial access was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome (comprising two or more combined outcomes) of net adverse clinical events (NACE), including death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction (injury of the heart muscle), stroke (insult to the brain), need to reintervene on the same site of coronary artery stenosis (narrowing), and bleeding during the first 30 days following intervention. When assessing individual outcomes, the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was similar between groups. Transradial access reduced death from cardiac causes, death from all causes during the first 30 days following intervention, bleeding, and local complications at the access site. The transradial approach shortened the length of stay in hospital, but was associated with a higher radiation exposure and more technical failures requiring an alternate vascular access route. </p>
<p>Coronary artery disease causes half of all cardiovascular deaths. Blood flow in blocked coronary arteries can be restored by using a catheter inserted through a peripheral artery. This allows balloons to widen the artery or stents to keep it open. Traditionally, the femoral (groin) artery was used for access, but now the radial (forearm) artery is also common. The transradial approach, while gaining popularity, can be more challenging and may take longer, with higher chances of technical failure and more radiation exposure for both patients and doctors. We compared the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches. The transradial method reduced combined adverse clinical events, including cardiac death, heart attacks, strokes, the need for repeat procedures, and bleeding within 30 days after the procedure. Individual risks of heart attacks and strokes were similar between the two methods. The transradial approach lowered the risk of cardiac death, overall death within 30 days, bleeding, and local complications, and shortened hospital stays. However, it was associated with higher radiation exposure and more technical failures requiring alternate access. </p>

<h3>Text #5:</h3>
<p>An aorto-iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto-iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. Endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent-graft) is placed inside the aorto-iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent-graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent-graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent-graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent-grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. </p>
<p>An aorto-iliac aneurysm is a bulge in the aorta and iliac arteries that can burst, causing severe, often fatal bleeding. Around 15,000 deaths occur each year in the USA from ruptured aortic aneurysms. To prevent this, repairs are recommended when the aorta reaches 5-5.5 cm or the iliac arteries reach 3-4 cm in diameter. One repair method is endovascular surgery, where a stent-graft is placed inside the aneurysm to redirect blood flow and exclude the aneurysm from circulation. This requires good seal zones in the aorta and iliac arteries. However, 40% of patients have inadequate distal seal zones in the iliac arteries. In such cases, the stent-graft is extended to the external iliac artery, and the internal iliac artery is blocked, which can cause complications like buttock pain, sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. New devices, like iliac branch stent-grafts, maintain blood flow to the internal iliac artery. These devices position the seal zone in the external iliac artery and have a side branch for the internal iliac artery, preserving pelvic blood flow and reducing serious complications, thus improving the quality of life for patients. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. CVD is a global burden and varies between regions, and this variation has been linked in part to dietary factors. Such factors are important because they can be modified to help with CVD prevention and management. This review assessed the effectiveness of increased fibre intake as a supplement or in food stuffs in reducing cardiovascular death, all-cause death, non-fatal endpoints (such as heart attacks, strokes and angina) and CVD risk factors in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD. Twenty three trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All of the trials were short term and so could not examine the effect of fibre intake on CVD events. All of the trials examined the effects of fibre intake on lipid levels (lipids are fat-like substances, including cholesterol found in the blood), blood pressure or both. Pooling the results showed a beneficial reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (sometimes called 'bad' cholesterol), and diastolic blood pressure with increasing fibre intake. There were no clear patterns for the type of fibre used (soluble or insoluble fibre) or the way in which fibre was provided (via supplements or food stuffs) but their were few studies in each group so results are uncertain. </p>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect the heart and blood vessels and are a global issue. Dietary factors, which can be changed, play a role in CVD prevention and management. This review looked at whether increasing fibre intake, either through supplements or food, reduces deaths from CVD, all-cause deaths, non-fatal events (like heart attacks, strokes, and angina), and CVD risk factors in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD. Twenty-three trials were included, but they were all short-term and couldn't assess the impact of fibre on actual CVD events. These trials examined the effects of fibre on blood lipid levels (such as cholesterol) and blood pressure. Results showed that higher fibre intake reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol), and diastolic blood pressure. There were no clear differences in the effects based on the type of fibre (soluble or insoluble) or whether it was taken as a supplement or in food, but there were few studies in each category, making the results uncertain. </p>

<p>Breaks (fractures) of the lower part of the thigh bone (distal femur) are debilitating and painful injuries. The reduced mobility after these injuries is also an important cause of ill-health. Sometimes these fractures happen in people who have previously had a knee replacement; this can make treatment of the fracture more complicated. Many treatments have been used in the management of these injuries. Historically, people were treated in bed with weights holding the leg straight. More recently, surgery has been used to fix the broken femur using metal implants (surgical fixation). Methods of surgical fixation include using plates and screws on the outside the femur or rods inside the femur to hold the fracture in place while it heals. The technology of these implants has become increasingly advanced with components that 'lock' together, forming a 'locked' device. Despite these advances, the best management of these injuries remains controversial. </p>

<p>Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay for treatment of moderate or severe depression. Fluvoxamine is one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. This review reports trials comparing fluvoxamine with other antidepressants for treatment of major depression. We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, there is evidence of differing side-effect profiles, especially when comparing gastrointestinal side effects between fluvoxamine and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including these differences in side effect profiles. </p>

While both medications and therapy can treat major depression, antidepressants (AD) are the primary treatment for moderate to severe cases. Fluvoxamine, an older selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is commonly prescribed. This review compares fluvoxamine with other antidepressants for major depression. It found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine is better or worse than other antidepressants in effectiveness and tolerability. However, there are differences in side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues, when comparing fluvoxamine to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Clinicians should consider these side effect differences when choosing a treatment. </p>

<p>Thalassaemia is a genetic (inherited) blood disorder that causes defects in adult haemoglobin (the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells) leading to destruction of the red blood cells and anaemia with different degrees of severity. Persistent anaemia can affect general health and reduce quality of life. People with NTDÎ²T may require periodic blood transfusion to replace the red blood cells and this could lead to excess iron being deposited in various organs in the body, affecting their function. People with NTDÎ²T have higher levels of HbF (the main form of haemoglobin found during the development of a baby before birth) which persists after birth. The amount of HbF that persists varies and people with a higher HbF level require less frequent blood transfusions. HbF inducers are substances which increase HbF levels without alteration to the gene. They may reduce the need for blood transfusion in people with NTDÎ²T. However, it is not known which HbF inducers are effective and safe, and if so, what the optimal dose is and at what age treatment should be started. </p>

People with NTDÎ²T may need periodic blood transfusions, which can cause excess iron buildup in organs, affecting their function. NTDÎ²T patients have higher levels of HbF (fetal haemoglobin), which remains after birth. Higher HbF levels mean less frequent transfusions are needed. HbF inducers are substances that increase HbF levels without changing the gene, potentially reducing the need for transfusions. However, it is unclear which HbF inducers are effective and safe, the best dosage, and the ideal age to start treatment. </p>

<p>PMS is characterised by a range of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms that are not due to any organic disease, and that occur during the luteal phase (second half) of the menstrual cycle and disappear at the onset of menstruation. It is now thought that the condition is due to complex interactions between ovarian steroids and neurotransmitters. A clinical diagnosis requires that the symptoms are confirmed by prospective recording for at least two menstrual cycles and that they cause substantial distress or impairment to daily life (e.g. work, school, social activities, hobbies, interpersonal relationships). We found very low quality evidence to suggest that oral unopposed oestrogen given in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is probably ineffective for controlling the symptoms of PMS and may even make them worse. There was very low quality evidence to support the effectiveness of continuous oestrogen (in the form of transdermal patches or subcutaneous implants) plus progestogen, with a small to moderate effect size. A comparison between 200 microgram and 100 microgram doses of continuous oestrogen was inconclusive with regard to effectiveness but suggested that the lower dose was less likely to cause side effects. Uncertainty remains regarding safety, as the identified studies were too small to provide definite answers. Moreover, none of the included trials addressed adverse effects that might occur beyond the typical trial duration of 2 to 8 months. This suggests the choice of oestrogen dose and mode of administration could be based on an individual womanâ€™s preference and modified according to the effectiveness and tolerability of the chosen regimen. </p>
<p>PMS involves a range of physical, psychological, and behavioral symptoms that occur in the second half of the menstrual cycle and disappear with menstruation. It is believed to result from interactions between ovarian hormones and brain chemicals. A clinical diagnosis requires tracking symptoms for at least two menstrual cycles, showing significant distress or impairment in daily life. Evidence suggests that oral unopposed estrogen in the luteal phase is probably ineffective for PMS and may worsen symptoms. Continuous estrogen (via patches or implants) plus progestogen shows low-quality evidence of a small to moderate benefit. The effectiveness of 200 microgram versus 100 microgram doses of continuous estrogen is unclear, though the lower dose may cause fewer side effects. The safety of these treatments remains uncertain due to small study sizes and lack of long-term data. Therefore, the choice of estrogen treatment should be based on individual preference and adjusted for effectiveness and side effects. </p>
