<p>Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital narrowing of the lumen in a section of the aorta. The narrowing is most commonly in the upper thoracic aorta but can occur in the abdominal aorta. It is present at birth and males are more often affected than females. Clinical symptoms are variable and depend on the position, degree and extent of the narrowed segment of the aorta. Other congenital heart abnormalities may also be present. In general, the diagnosis is made by finding a difference in pulsations and blood pressure between the upper body and arms and the lower body and legs. If left unrepaired, average survival is 31 years. The treatment of CoA is intended to improve life expectancy and quality of life by reducing the incidence of aortic and cardiac disabling conditions such as aneurysm (dilation) of the ascending aorta, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and aortic and mitral valvular disease. The treatment of CoA consists of enlarging of the narrowed segment. Traditionally this required open heart surgery. Balloon angioplasty became available as an alternative treatment in the 1980s but recurrence, aneurysm and aortic dissection (a tear in the inner wall of the aorta causing blood to flow between the layers of the blood vessel wall) remained disadvantages of both treatments. In the early 1990s, endovascular stents were introduced and have become an alternative approach to surgical repair. </p>
<p>Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a birth defect where the aorta is narrowed, usually in the upper thoracic area but sometimes in the abdominal area. It affects males more often than females. Symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the narrowing and may include other heart abnormalities. Diagnosis is typically made by detecting differences in pulse and blood pressure between the upper and lower body. Without treatment, the average survival is 31 years. Treatment aims to improve life expectancy and quality of life by reducing complications like aortic aneurysms, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and valve diseases. Traditionally, open-heart surgery was used to widen the narrowed section. Balloon angioplasty became an option in the 1980s, but issues like recurrence and aortic dissection were common. In the early 1990s, endovascular stents were introduced as an alternative to surgery and have since become a preferred treatment. </p>

<p>Cervical cancer arises from the neck of the womb (cervix). Cervical screening programmes have decreased the rate of advanced cervical cancer. However, a significant number of cases still present with locally advanced disease that involves large cervical tumours (> 4 cm) or tumours that extend to the upper vagina. The larger the primary tumour, the greater the likelihood of metastasis (spread of cancer to other areas of the body). Cervical cancer spreads to the lymph nodes in the pelvis and around the aorta (one of the major blood vessels in the abdomen). Stage is a standardised assessment of the size of the cancer and if it has spread to adjacent or distant sites. Stage for stage, women with para-aortic lymph node metastases at presentation have a lower survival than those who do not have para-aortic metastases at presentation. Accurate detection of involved para-aortic lymph nodes helps to tailor radiotherapy so that it includes this area (extended-field radiotherapy). It also provides prognostic information. Different methods have been used to detect para-aortic lymph node metastases including surgical and radiological (various types of x-rays) techniques; however, it is unclear which is more accurate. </p>
<p>Cervical cancer starts in the cervix, the neck of the womb. Screening programs have reduced advanced cases, but many still present with large tumors (> 4 cm) or tumors spreading to the upper vagina. Larger tumors are more likely to metastasize (spread) to lymph nodes in the pelvis and around the aorta. The cancer stage indicates its size and spread. Women with para-aortic lymph node metastases at diagnosis have a lower survival rate. Detecting these metastases accurately helps tailor radiotherapy to include the affected area and provides important prognostic information. Both surgical and radiological methods are used for detection, but it is unclear which is more accurate. </p>

<p>These results must be considered with caution. There is a lack of confidence in the results due to the small number of included studies and the inability to pool the results due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures. Most exercise interventions produced improvement in one or more of the measured outcomes including pain, range of motion, strength and walking tolerance. Hydrotherapy may be more effective than land exercises for pain relief in adults. Functional exercises such as treadmill walking and partial weight bearing exercises seem to be more effective than static or short arc exercises for improving muscle strength. These findings are consistent with the many non-controlled intervention reports in the haemophilia literature. No adverse effects were reported as a result of any of the interventions. However, some groups used prophylactic factor prior to exercise and other groups studied only subjects with moderate haemophilia. Therefore, the safety of these techniques for persons with severe haemophilia remains unclear. </p>

<p>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw joint is located in front of the ear on either side of the face. However, it is the only joint that the dentists and maxillofacial surgeons predominantly have to deal with. As with many of the other joints, the TMJ can be affected by osteoarthritis (OA). This is characterized by progressive destruction of the internal surfaces of the joint which can result in debilitating pain and joint noises. Several disorders other than OA may affect the TMJ and the correct diagnosis is important such that it can be matched with appropriate therapy. A range of therapeutic options are available for TMJ OA, which include non-surgical modalities such as control of contributory factors, occlusal appliances, cold or warm packs applied to the joint, pharmacological interventions as well as physiotherapy. Surgical treatment options include intra-articular injections, arthrocentesis (lavage of the joint) as well as attempts at repair or replacement of portions of the TMJ. </p>
<p>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is located in front of the ear on both sides of the face. Dentists and maxillofacial surgeons often treat issues with the TMJ, including osteoarthritis (OA). OA causes the joint's internal surfaces to break down, leading to pain and joint noises. Other disorders can also affect the TMJ, so an accurate diagnosis is crucial for proper treatment. Therapies for TMJ OA include non-surgical options like addressing contributing factors, using occlusal appliances, applying cold or warm packs, medications, and physiotherapy. Surgical options include joint injections, joint lavage (arthrocentesis), and repairing or replacing parts of the TMJ. </p>

<p>There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available: Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. </p>
<p>There are few high-quality trials on treatments for acute otitis externa. This review's results mainly come from single trials with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes. The findings may not fully apply to primary care, as only two of the 19 trials were conducted in such settings, and 11 included ear cleaning, which is not common in primary care. Despite these limitations, some conclusions can be made: Topical treatments are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa, and the specific type of topical treatment generally doesn't affect the outcome much. Differences in effectiveness were minor and inconsistent over time. Acetic acid worked as well as antibiotic/steroid at week 1 but was less effective for longer treatments, and symptoms lasted two days longer with acetic acid compared to antibiotic/steroid. </p>

<p>Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. </p>

<p>We did not find any studies that compared intratympanic corticosteroids to no treatment or placebo (dummy) treatment. Intratympanic corticosteroids might result in little or no difference in hearing when compared to people who receive systemic corticosteroids, and might make little to no difference in the number of people whose hearing improves. The side effects may be different with these two types of treatment. With intratympanic treatment, people may have an increase in the risk of dizziness or ear pain as compared to systemic corticosteroids, typically at the time of injection, and some may develop a small hole in the ear drum. However, systemic treatment may also cause an increased risk of different side effects, such as problems with sugar levels in the blood. Taking intratympanic corticosteroids as well as systemic corticosteroids might result in a small improvement in hearing compared to systemic corticosteroids alone, but it is uncertain how many people would notice an improvement. As above, intratympanic treatment may cause some side effects, but we cannot be certain of the number of people who may experience these. </p>
<p>We found no studies comparing intratympanic corticosteroids to no treatment or placebo. Intratympanic corticosteroids might have little or no impact on hearing compared to systemic corticosteroids and may not significantly affect the number of people whose hearing improves. Side effects differ between the two treatments: intratympanic corticosteroids may increase the risk of dizziness or ear pain during injection and cause small ear drum holes, while systemic corticosteroids may affect blood sugar levels. Combining both treatments might slightly improve hearing, but it's unclear how many people would notice this improvement. The exact number of people who might experience side effects from intratympanic treatment is also uncertain. </p>

<p>Children with cerebral palsy can be significantly disabled in terms of their ability to suck, chew and swallow. This can lead to significant impairment in feeding and, eventually, to undernutrition. It can also result in aspiration of food into the lungs. Length of feeding time may be considerably increased and, instead of being an enjoyable experience, mealtimes may be distressing for both child and carer. For children unable to maintain a normal nutritional state feeding by mouth, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes are increasingly being used to provide the digestive system with nutrients. A gastrostomy tube is a feeding tube inserted surgically through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach. A jejunostomy feeding tube is inserted into the jejunum, part of the small intestine, either directly or via a previous gastrostomy. Although gastrostomy or jejunostomy placement may greatly facilitate the feeding of children with cerebral palsy, many carers find it very emotionally difficult to accept this intervention. Moreover, the intervention is costly and there is the possibility of complications. The effectiveness and safety of the treatment requires further assessment. </p>

<p>Fourteen clinical trials, involving 721 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Thirteen studies compared a pharmaceutical treatment with placebo (or a low dose of the intervention), in heterogenous groups of degenerative cerebellar ataxias. Three compounds were studied in two trials each: a levorotatory form of 5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5HT), idebenone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone tartrate (TRH-T); each of the other compounds (riluzole, varenicline, buspirone, betamethasone, coenzyme Q10 with vitamin E, α-tocopheryl quinone and erythropoietin) were studied in one trial. The 14th trial, involving a mixed group of participants with spinocerebellar ataxia, compared the effectiveness of nonspecific physiotherapy and occupational therapy within an inpatient hospital setting to no treatment. No studies utilised traditional speech therapies. We defined the primary outcome measure in this review as the percentage change (improvement) in overall speech production immediately following completion of the intervention or later, measured by any validated speech assessment tool. None of the trials included speech as a primary outcome or examined speech using any validated speech assessment tool. Eleven studies reported speech outcomes derived from a subscale embedded within disease rating scales. The remaining three studies used alternative assessments to measure speech, including mean time to produce a standard sentence, a subjective rating of speech on a 14-point analogue scale, patient-reported assessment of the impact of dysarthria on activities of daily living and acoustic measures of syllable length. </p>

<p>Heavy or dangerous patterns of drinking alcohol can lead to accidents, injuries, physical and psychiatric illnesses, frequent sickness, absence from employment and social problems. Long term alcohol consumption has harmful effects on almost all organs of the body, particularly the brain and gastro-intestinal system. Healthcare professionals have the opportunity to ask people about how much alcohol they drink and offer brief interventions to heavy drinkers. These brief interventions involve a time limited intervention focusing on changing behaviour. They range from a single session providing information and advice to one to three sessions of motivational interviewing or skills-based counselling involving feedback and discussion on responsibility and self efficacy. Different health professionals who do not require to be alcohol specialists may give the intervention. Admission to hospital as an inpatient, in general medical wards and trauma centres, provides an opportunity whereby heavy alcohol users are accessible, have time for an intervention, and may be made aware of any links between their hospitalisation and alcohol. The review authors identified 14 randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials involving 4041 mainly male adults (16 years or older) identified as heavy drinkers in hospital, mainly in the UK and USA. </p>

Long-term alcohol use harms nearly all organs, especially the brain and digestive system. Healthcare professionals can ask patients about their alcohol use and offer brief interventions to heavy drinkers. These interventions are short and aim to change behavior, ranging from a single advice session to one to three sessions of motivational interviewing or counseling on responsibility and self-efficacy. These can be provided by various health professionals, not just alcohol specialists. Hospitals offer a chance to reach heavy drinkers, as patients have time and may recognize the connection between their alcohol use and hospitalization. The review included 14 trials with 4041 mainly male adults identified as heavy drinkers in hospitals, mostly in the UK and USA. </p>
